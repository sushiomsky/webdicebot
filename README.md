## Features in Detail

### Betting Configuration Panel
Configure all aspects of your betting strategy:
- **Base Bet Amount**: Starting bet size
- **Win Chance**: Probability of winning (affects payout)
- **Prediction**: Roll Over or Roll Under
- **Payout Multiplier**: Automatically calculated based on win chance

### Strategy Options

#### Martingale
Classic doubling strategy - doubles bet after each loss, resets after win. High risk, high reward.

#### Fibonacci
Uses Fibonacci sequence for bet progression. More conservative than Martingale.
